# CONVENTIONS — dppu Engine Geometric Conventions

This document fixes the **geometric, index, and sign conventions** shared between `BaseFrameEngine` and each topology runner in the `dppu` package.
**All runners must define `metric_frame` and `structure_constants` according to these conventions.**

⇒ [日本語版](CONVENTIONS_ja.md) | [SymPy ガイドライン](SymPy_guideline.md)

## 1. Scope and Assumptions

* All quantities treated here are expressed as components on a **Frame (Orthonormal Basis)**.
* `metric_frame` is the frame metric $(g_{ab})$, which defaults to $(g_{ab}=\delta_{ab})$ (`Matrix.eye(dim)`).
* The curvature component calculation in the DPPUv2 engine currently assumes a situation where **frame directional derivatives are unnecessary**.
  Specifically, the runner must adopt a setting where structure constants $(C^a{}_{bc})$ and connection coefficients $(\Gamma^a{}_{bc})$ are treated as "constants with respect to the frame" (e.g., left-invariant frames).
  * **Note:** This design is **rational and efficient** for handling homogeneous spaces like $S^3 \times S^1$ (Lie groups) or Nil manifolds. However, note that this assumption may become a bottleneck if handling general curved spacetimes with low symmetry in the future.

## 2. Indices and Array Index Order

Array storage is fixed as follows:

* Structure constants: `C[a,b,c] = C^a_{bc}`
* Connection coefficients: `Gamma[a,b,c] = Γ^a_{bc}`
* Riemann curvature: `Riemann[a,b,c,d] = R^a_{bcd}`

Meaning of indices:

* $(a)$: Output (superscript) component
* $(b,c,d)$: Input (subscript) components
  In particular, $(\Gamma^a{}_{bc})$ corresponds to $(\nabla_{E_c} E_b = \Gamma^a{}_{bc} E_a)$ (the last index $(c)$ is the "direction of differentiation").

## 3. Definitions of Frame, Coframe, and Structure Constants (Most Important)

Let the dual of the frame be $(\{E_a\})$ and the coframe (1-forms) be $(\{e^a\})$.

### 3.1 Structure Equations of Coframe (Fixed)

$$
de^a = \frac12 C^a{}_{bc} e^b\wedge e^c,
\qquad C^a{}_{bc} = - C^a{}_{cb}.
$$

### 3.2 Commutation Relations of Dual Frame (Equivalent)

The above definition is equivalent to:
$$
[E_b, E_c] = - C^a{}_{bc} E_a.
$$

> Note: Many textbooks adopt $([E_b,E_c]=+f^a{}_{bc}E_a)$.
> This project adopts the convention **$(C^a{}_{bc}=-f^a{}_{bc})$ relative to that $(f^a{}_{bc})$**.

### 3.3 Runner Implementation Rules (Recommended)

* **Do not manually input C**. If possible, specify `de^a` on the runner side, extract `C^a_{bc}` by coefficient comparison, and put it into `self.data['structure_constants']=C`.
* At a minimum, automatically check that $C^a_{bc}$ is **antisymmetric in b,c**.

## 4. Connection (Spin Connection) and Metric Compatibility

Define the connection 1-form as:
$$
\omega^a{}_b = \Gamma^a{}_{bc} e^c
$$

Metric compatibility (Lorentz connection / Orthogonal connection) is fixed as a specification:
$$
\omega_{ab} = -\omega_{ba}
\quad(\Leftrightarrow\quad
\Gamma_{abc} = -\Gamma_{bac})
$$
where $(\Gamma_{abc} = g_{ad}\Gamma^d{}_{bc})$.

## 5. Levi-Civita Connection (General Koszul Implementation in v3 Engine)

When the frame is orthonormal and the above structure constant conventions are adopted, the Levi-Civita connection is calculated in the DPPUv2 engine using the following **General Koszul Formula**:

$$
\Gamma^a{}_{bc}
= \frac12\Big(
C^a{}_{bc} + C^c{}_{ba} - C^b{}_{ac}
\Big).
$$

(This is the form when the sign of the commutation relation in Section 3.2 is adopted.)

**Important Notes:**

1. This formula **does not assume a bi-invariant metric**.
   It functions correctly as the Levi-Civita connection on left-invariant frames, even for non-bi-invariant cases like Nil³.

2. In special cases where structure constants are totally antisymmetric in lower indices $C_{abc} = -C_{bac} = -C_{acb}$ (like SU(2)),
   this formula reduces to $\Gamma^a_{bc} = \frac{1}{2} C^a_{bc}$.

3. The engine automatically verifies **metric compatibility** $\Gamma_{abc} + \Gamma_{bac} = 0$ after calculation.
   If this is violated, it immediately throws an exception as an implementation error.

## 6. Torsion and Curvature

Torsion 2-form:
$$
T^a = de^a + \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b,
\qquad
T^a = \frac12 T^a{}_{bc} e^b\wedge e^c.
$$

Curvature 2-form:
$$
R^a{}_b = d\omega^a{}_b + \omega^a{}_c\wedge \omega^c{}_b,
\qquad
R^a{}_b = \frac12 R^a{}_{bcd} e^c\wedge e^d.
$$

## 7. Curvature Component Formula (Form used by Engine)

The DPPUv2 engine currently uses the following form for $R^a_{bcd}$:

$$
R^a{}_{bcd}
=
\Gamma^a{}_{ec}\Gamma^e{}_{bd}
-\Gamma^a{}_{ed}\Gamma^e{}_{bc}
+\Gamma^a{}_{be} C^e{}_{cd}.
$$

> Important: Generally, a frame directional derivative term
> $(E_c(\Gamma^a{}_{bd}) - E_d(\Gamma^a{}_{bc}))$
> appears here, but the DPPUv2 engine does not explicitly handle it.
> Therefore, the runner must adopt a setting where **$(\Gamma)$ is treated as constant in the frame direction**, such as with left-invariant frames.

## 8. Mandatory Self-Checks (Consistency the Runner Must Satisfy)

The runner must satisfy the following (failure implies definition inconsistency with the engine):

1. Antisymmetry of Structure Constants:
   $$
   C^a{}_{bc} + C^a{}_{cb} = 0.
   $$

2. Metric Compatibility (Orthogonal Connection):
   $$
   \omega_{ab} + \omega_{ba} = 0.
   $$

3. Antisymmetry of Riemann (Target of engine's strict check):
   $$
   R_{ab cd} = -R_{ba cd},\qquad
   R_{ab cd} = -R_{ab dc}.
   $$

## 9. Weyl Tensor and Conformal Scalar

### 9.1 Weyl Tensor Definition (4D)

$$
C_{abcd} = R_{abcd}
- \frac{1}{2}(g_{ac}R_{bd} - g_{ad}R_{bc} - g_{bc}R_{ad} + g_{bd}R_{ac})
+ \frac{R}{6}(g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc}).
$$

Key properties:
- **Traceless**: $C^a{}_{bad} = 0$ (holds for all index pairs)
- **Conformally invariant**: invariant under $g_{ab} \to \Omega^2 g_{ab}$
- **Conformal flatness criterion**: $C_{abcd} = 0 \Leftrightarrow$ conformally flat

Note on frame basis (orthonormal): since $g_{ab} = \delta_{ab}$, raising and lowering indices is the identity operation; components $C_{abcd}$ and $C^{abcd}$ can be treated identically.

### 9.2 Weyl Scalar

$$
C^2 = C_{abcd}\,C^{abcd} = \sum_{a,b,c,d} C_{abcd}^2.
$$

In the frame basis, the sum is computed directly without index raising.
$C^2 = 0$ holds for isotropic $S^3 \times S^1$ at $\varepsilon = 0$ and for $T^3 \times S^1$ identically.

### 9.3 Engine Implementation

- Module: `dppu/curvature/weyl.py`
  - `compute_weyl_tensor(R_abcd, Ricci, R_scalar, metric, dim)` → $C_{abcd}$
  - `compute_weyl_scalar(C_abcd, metric_inv, dim)` → $C^2$
- Pipeline step: `E4.3b` (immediately after the Levi-Civita curvature computation)

## 10. Squashed Homogeneous Spaces and the $\varepsilon$-Parameter

### 10.1 Definition of Squashing

A volume-preserving anisotropy deformation parameter $\varepsilon$ is introduced.
$\varepsilon = 0$ is the isotropic reference point. Physical range: $\varepsilon \in (-1, +\infty)$ ($\varepsilon = -1$ is a singularity where structure constants diverge).

### 10.2 Topology-Dependent Structure Constant Scaling

The base structure constants $C^a{}_{bc}(\varepsilon=0)$ on the left-invariant frame are scaled as follows.

**$S^3 \times S^1$ (SU(2)):**

| Frame index $a$ | Scale factor $\lambda_a(\varepsilon)$ |
|---|---|
| $a \in \{0, 1\}$ | $(1+\varepsilon)^{2/3}$ |
| $a = 2$ | $(1+\varepsilon)^{-4/3}$ |

Volume preservation: $\lambda_0\lambda_1\lambda_2 = (1+\varepsilon)^{2/3+2/3-4/3} = 1$.

**$\mathrm{Nil}^3 \times S^1$ (Heisenberg group):**

| Non-trivial index $a$ | Scale factor |
|---|---|
| $a = 2$ (non-commutative component) | $(1+\varepsilon)^{-4/3}$ |

As $\varepsilon \to +\infty$, the structure constants vanish and the geometry asymptotes to flat $T^3$-like behaviour.

**$T^3 \times S^1$ (Abelian group):**

Structure constants are identically zero ($C^a{}_{bc} = 0$). The $\varepsilon$-deformation is not defined. $C^2 = 0$ holds identically, so the Weyl term vanishes (null test).

### 10.3 Physical Limits

| Limit | Physical meaning |
|---|---|
| $\varepsilon = 0$ | Isotropic $S^3$: $C^2 = 0$, stable vacuum of Paper I |
| $\varepsilon \to +\infty$ | $\mathrm{Nil}^3$ flat limit ($C^2 \to 0$ asymptotically) |
| $\varepsilon \to -1^+$ | Singularity of $S^3$ structure (physically inaccessible) |
| $\varepsilon = -2$ | Mathematical root of $C^2 = 0$, excluded since $\varepsilon < -1$ |
