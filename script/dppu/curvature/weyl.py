"""
Weyl Tensor and Scalar Computation
==================================

Computes the Weyl tensor (conformal curvature) and Weyl scalar (C^2).

Mathematical Definition:
    C_{abcd} = R_{abcd} 
             - (1/2)(g_{ac}R_{bd} - g_{ad}R_{bc} - g_{bc}R_{ad} + g_{bd}R_{ac})
             + (R/6)(g_{ac}g_{bd} - g_{ad}g_{bc})

    C^2 = C_{abcd}C^{abcd}

Properties:
    - Trace-free: C^a_{bad} = 0
    - Same symmetries as Riemann tensor
    - Vanishes for conformally flat spacetimes (e.g., S^3 x R is conformally flat?)
      Actually S^3 is conformally flat, but S^3 x S^1 is not necessarily so.
      However, S^3 x R^1 is conformally flat.
